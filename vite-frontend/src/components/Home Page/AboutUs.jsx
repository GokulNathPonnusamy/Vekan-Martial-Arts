From these humble origins, <strong>our classes have evolved into an Indoor Academy proudly known as Vekan Martial Arts Sports Academy</strong>. It is with great pride that we declare ourselves as the <strong>first indoor class in Tiruvannamalai district</strong>. Our commitment to excellence and innovation continues to shape the martial arts experience we offer. Join us as we celebrate the rich history and progress of Vekan Martial Arts Sports Academy.</p>
